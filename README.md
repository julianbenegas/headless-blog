# next-typescript

The objective of this boilerplate is to set up everything the developer will need (in terms of configuration) to start a next + typescript project. Eslint, prettier and husky are configured to work independent of the user's IDE configuration (as long as it's vscode).

## Featured aspects of the stack

- Typescript
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- next-themes

## Things to note

- It comes with Inter (it's better to host fonts here rather than getting them from google fonts). Remove it if you are not going to use it.
- Pages, components, etc... are located under `/src`. If you are changing this, be sure to also update `tsconfig.json`'s `baseUrl`.
- If you are **not** using Tailwind, you can remove `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`.
- It comes with `next-themes`, so dark mode ready. If you're not using it, just remove the library.
